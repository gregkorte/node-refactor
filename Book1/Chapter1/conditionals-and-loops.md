# Conditionals and While Loops
Learning Objectives:
1. `if`/`else`, `while`, (`for` and `foreach` will be covered later)
1. `false` or 'falsy' in JS
1. string methods: `trim`

### Checking User Input

To ensure that our user provides input rather than just pressing `Enter` without typing anything, we can use conditionals in Node.js. To check for data that is neither null, undefined nor an empty string we will have to write a utility function. We'll update our program accordingly.

```javascript
const readline = require("readline");

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const isNullOrEmpty = (str) => {
    return !str || str.trim() === ''
}

const greeting = `Welcome to Thrown For a Loop
Your one-stop shop for used sporting equipment`;
console.log(greeting);

rl.question("Please enter a product name: ", (response) => {

    if (isNullOrEmpty(response)) {
        console.log("You didn't choose anything!");
    } else {
        console.log(`You chose: ${response}`);
    }

  rl.close();
});
```
Run the updated program, and test all of the cases we have accounted for:
1. The user enters some text and presses `Enter`
1. The user presses `Enter` without entering text

Remember, in Javascript, it is possible to put expressions that evaluate to "falsy" values as conditions for `if`, ternaries, `for` and `while` loops. Values like `null`, `undefined`, `0`, and importantly here, `""`, are treated as `false` for the sake of evaluating the expression.

``` javascript
if (!response) {
    console.log("You didn't choose anything!");
} else {
    console.log(`You chose: ${response}`);
}
```

Since we'll be doing this in more than one place we can _abstract_ away the logic into its own utility function, so we can call it whenever we need to. This simplifies the usage of the function and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

### Let the User Try Again
Let's change our program so that if the user doesn't provide input, the program asks for valid input again. To accomplish this, we can use a `while` loop. Just like `if`, while requires an actual `boolean` (`true` or `false`) inside the parentheses. We can replace our `if` with the loop:

``` csharp
while (string.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
{
    Console.WriteLine("You didn't choose anything, try again!");
    response = Console.ReadLine();
}

Console.WriteLine($"You chose: {response}");
```
There are two things to notice here. The first is that we can reassign `response`, similar to a variable declared with `let` in Javascript. For the second, let's run the program a few more times.
1. The first time, hit `Enter` without entering any text, and ensure that our program asks us for input again. Then, enter any text and hit `Enter`.
1. The second time, type three spaces and press `Enter`. What happened?

It looks like we might not have handled the edge case of a user entering only spaces. There are a few ways we can handle this problem, and we will explore two now.

The first is to use `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` instead of `IsNullOrEmpty` like this:
```
while (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(response))
...
```

This would work well, because all-whitespace answers would fail the test. However, we might be better off using `Trim` to remove any whitespace from our response first, because we probably don't want those extra spaces in valid responses either. So we can do this:
``` csharp
string response = Console.ReadLine().Trim();

while (string.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
{
    Console.WriteLine("You didn't choose anything, try again!");
    response = Console.ReadLine().Trim();
}

Console.WriteLine($"You chose: {response}");
```
This will turn any whitespace-only answers into empty answers, and will also trim any valid answers with whitespace on the ends. This is a good opportunity to notice that because `ReadLine` returns a `string`, we can chain `string` methods onto the call to `ReadLine`.

Test the program again to make sure that it works as expected. What cases do you need to test to know it does what we intend?
