> Prompts: Let's assume students have already been through a three month course which taught them basic to intermediate understanding of html, css and javascript. Assume they have learned the following concepts:
 - data types
 - methods
 - object manipulation
 - modularization
 - functions
 - react
 - react dom
 - json-server
> Now pick up where that course left off and introduce Node.js to them with the end goal in three months being to build a full stack application using either react, next, vue or angular.


Got it! Letâ€™s adjust the program to focus on building a full-stack application with the required CRUD operations, relationships, and user-specific data by the end of the course. We'll ensure the progression is gradual, focusing on building essential skills before tackling more complex concepts.

Here's the revised outline:
