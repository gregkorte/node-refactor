# Table of Contents
The course is split into five books with a sixth book dedicated to capstone resources. The fifth book is important but not strictly necessary in order to complete the program and graduate from NSS. You will work through these books in order at your own pace, but a general time estimate is provided to help you stay on track for graduation.
