# Concepts of Software Development

During your time at Nashville Software School, you will primarily be learning the vocation of the craft by doing. Lecture about concepts is kept to a minimum, and live-coding is meant to introduce you to the syntax and structure of an application. After that, you are expected to research and learn as a team, with continued guidance and mentoring from your instruction staff.

In the server side foundations part of the course, it is time to start introducing you to some of the common, simpler patterns that responsible developers use to build flexible, extensible, and maintainable applications.

# Basic Pillars (EPA)

These concepts are general and provide little guidance to making large, complex software more maintainable. However, each more specific principle or pattern that you learn will fall under one or more of these.

1. [Polymorphism](./epa/POLYMORPHISM.md)
1. [Encapsulation](./epa/ENCAPSULATION.md)
1. [Abstraction](./epa/ABSTRACTION.md)

# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principle are more specific in nature and actually provide guidance to software developers on how to craft robust, flexible, extensible software applications that they can be proud of.

1. [Single Responsibility](./solid/SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY_PRINCIPLE.md) is about actors and high level architecture.
1. [Open / Closed](./solid/OPEN_CLOSED_PRINCIPLE.md) is about class design and feature extensions.
1. [Liskov's Substitution](./solid/LISKOV_SUBSTITUTION_PRINCIPLE.md) is about subtyping and inheritance.
1. [Interface Segregation](./solid/INTERFACE_SEGREGATION_PRINCIPLE.md) is about business logic to clients communication.
1. [Dependency Inversion](./solid/DEPENDENCY_INVERSION_PRINCIPLE.md) is about coding to interfaces, or abstractions.

# GoF Design patterns

A team of developers, called the Gang of Four, codified common, practical patterns that software developers use to build applications.

You will likely encounter a two or three of the simpler ones while you are at NSS, but the majority of the patterns are only needed in large scale, complex software libraries, so we spend almost no time covering them.

You do need to be aware of their existence, as you will likely need some of them during your career.
