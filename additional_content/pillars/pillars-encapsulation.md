# Encapsulation

The encapsulation concept is all about defining what data needs to be manipulated, defining the methods that need to be exposed to manipulate the data, and then hiding the internal representation of that data. Our current code encapsulates all of the functionality needed to create a basic animal and make it walk.

However, we hide the implementation of setting the speed of the animal since we want to control how it is set based on the simple algorithm in the `walk()` method.  That's called Information Hiding because no external actor (i.e. code) can access, or set, the walking speed of the animal. It can only specify the number of legs that the animal has.
